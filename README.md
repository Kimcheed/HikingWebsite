# HikingWebsite
Welcome to our Mock University Hiking Website!

This project is a mock hiking website with various functionality.

The live site can be viewed at: https://kimcheed.github.io/HikingWebsite/

In total, there are 6 different pages with different functionality.

Home: Displays basic information and has taskbar for navigation.

Application: Allows Hikers to submit information and sign up for updates.

Calendar/Locations: While this is two pages, we plan to combine these into one page eventually. These will be updated with the database. This will show locations and dates available to Hikers.

Resources: This page shows resources Hikers can use to progress in Hiking.

Contact: This page will allow the Hiker to send information to contact further with the email response in the application email.
